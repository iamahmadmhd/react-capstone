# Meta Front-End Developer Capstone Project

This repository contains the final project for the **Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate** on Coursera. The project demonstrates the application of front-end development skills acquired throughout the program.

## Overview

This project showcases a fully functional front-end application, emphasizing modern design principles and responsive web development. It aims to simulate a real-world project by integrating technologies and best practices used in professional front-end development.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interfaces with smooth interactions.
- **Accessible**: Follows accessibility standards for an inclusive user experience.
- **Modern Front-End Practices**: Built with reusable components, modular code, and state management.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For semantic structure and accessibility.
- **CSS3**: For styling, animations, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and dynamic features.
- **React**: For building reusable UI components and managing state.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and project hosting.
